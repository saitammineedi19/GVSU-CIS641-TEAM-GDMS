    <h1>Welcome to My Term Project</h1>
    <h2>Inventory Management System</h2>
    <p>The term project for the course System Analysis and Design that I'm doing along with my team developed a software system for Inventory Management System (IMS) that helps firms manage and control their inventory more efficiently. The IMS is a digital solution for recording and storing product information, processing orders, and managing suppliers. It includes various major features and functionalities, such as:
        
      Product Management(Adding items to the inventory, updating the inventory)
      Data Storage(storing items to the inventory)
      Inventory Transfer(Transferring items from one location to other location).
      We used Python programming and flask framework to develop the system.</p>
