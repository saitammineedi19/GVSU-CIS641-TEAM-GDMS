    <h1>Welcome to My Term Project</h1>
    <h2>Inventory Management System</h2>
    <p>Any business that involves in supply chain management needs to have an efficient inventory management system(IMS). In today's competitive business environment, efficient inventory management is crucial for optimizing costs, reducing waste, and ensuring customer satisfaction. This proposal outlines a comprehensive project for the analysis, design, and implementation of an Inventory Management System (IMS). This project assumes that no existing inventory system is in place. 
      The term project for the course System Analysis and Design that I'm doing along with my team developed a software system for Inventory Management System (IMS) that helps firms manage and control their inventory more efficiently. The IMS is a digital solution for recording and storing product information, processing orders, and managing suppliers. It includes various major features and functionalities, such as:</p>  
    <ul>Adding items to the inventory</ul>
    <ul>updating the inventory</ul>
    <ul>Data Storage(storing items to the inventory)</ul>
    <ul>Inventory Transfer(Transferring items from one location to other location)</ul>
    <p>We used Python programming and flask framework to develop the system.</p>
