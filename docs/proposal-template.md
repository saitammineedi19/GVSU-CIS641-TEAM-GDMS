# Introduction

Any business that involves in supply chain management needs to have an 
efficient inventory management system(IMS). In today's competitive 
business environment, efficient inventory 
management is crucial for optimizing costs, reducing waste, and ensuring 
customer satisfaction. This proposal outlines a comprehensive project for 
the analysis, design, and implementation of an Inventory Management System 
(IMS). This project assumes that no existing inventory system is in place

# Anticipated Technologies

Python or java

# Method/Approach
We are using a structured approach in completing this project. We need 
to identify the business requirements that are going to be implemented 
in the project. Based on the requirements, we need to develop a UI to view 
or add the items/ update the quantities to the items in the inventory. For 
developing this we need to write a code for the user interface and for the 
business requirement and also for the database operations.

(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)

# Estimated Timeline

## Major Milestones:
- Finalizing on the requirements for which the IMS needs to be developed. 
It'll be done by Oct 3 2023.
- Finalizing on the technologies to be adopted. Anticipated deadline Oct 
5th.
- Developing a code for the business requirements and UI. Anticipated 
deadline Oct-15
- Documenting finalized requirements and project progress and 
achievements.
(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)

# Anticipated Problem

The anticipated problem that we feel to face in this project is to extend 
it's functionality. The plan is to make this project work in such a way 
that it should  not be basic nor to make it complicated by adding the 
every possible requirement that a business can have. Understanding and 
figuring out the essential requirements is going to be crucia.
